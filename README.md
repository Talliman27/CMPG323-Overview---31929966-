# .gitignore
The gitignore file will act as a file that ignores any unnecessary files that GitHub doesnt need. Files that are not important will be linked to this gitignore file and will ultimately be ignored by GitHub. For example, any files that I will use to add data or images that I may need will only be for my own use and does not require the need to tracked or visible to anyone or GitHub.

# Storage and credentials
Credentials and information are a very important aspect to keep my projects secure. Authorisation will be used as well as two step verification or SSH keys that only trusted sources will know. This will give only a certain amount of users access to my repositories and projects.
