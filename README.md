# .gitignore
The gitignore file will act as a file that ignores any unnecessary files that GitHub doesnt need. Files that are not important will be linked to this gitignore file and will ultimately be ignored by GitHub. For example, any files that I will use to add data or images that I may need will only be for my own use and does not require the need to tracked or visible to anyone or GitHub.

# Storage and credentials
Credentials and information are a very important aspect to keep my projects secure. Authorisation will be used as well as two step verification or SSH keys that only trusted sources will know. This will give only a certain amount of users access to my repositories and projects.

# Branching Strategies
Each repository will have a main branch, a branch for developments and features and a testing branch. Development and coding will be done in the development branch and tested in the testing branch. Testing is done to determine that everything is in working order and can be merged together with other branches. After testing is done and all branches is in working order, they will be merged together in the merge branch and then ultimately merged back to the main branch.
